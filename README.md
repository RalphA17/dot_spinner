# Dot spinner

<!-- Short description of what your project does(3-4 senetnces)-->
This is a small project that is designed to be used as a loading screen. This project displays an animation of circles rotating clockwise to demonstrate a loading symbole. 

## Technologies

<!-- Technologies you used -->

## The Process

<!-- The process of how I build it -->
I wanted to keep the animation simple and effective. I decieded to keep the animation in the center of the screen and create one dot that would hold the fading animation. My goal was create 12 dots but only had the darkest color dot go in a circular like motion. One dot moving clockwise as the fading of the previous dot becomes lighter. Using the animation delay by -0.1 for each dot I could create the illusion of the dot fading. 


## What I learned

<!-- In 2-3 sentences tell everyone what you learned -->
I learned how I needed to plan my task. By writing out each task at a time using notion and checking off each task I do not feel as overwhelmed. As long as I can keep my GitHub updated with what I do each day, I can demostrate what I have been doing each day. 

## How it can be improved?

<!--What I could've done better -->
If I had time to improve this project today I would include other spinning animations and keep them side to side. Same animation, but different shapes and sizes.
